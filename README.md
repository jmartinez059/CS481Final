# CS481Final

CS 481 Final Project 

The goal of this project is to make a fully functional application using Xamarin.Forms. Attempt to address a meaningful user concern for mobile users. In the end you should have a tested app, available on source control, capable of being released on the App store. The idea does not need to be 100% original but should have some new features and be entirely implemented by you and or your group. If you have a large idea that you do not think can be completed by the due date that is fine. Pick a feature or two from idea and implement those then continue working on app after the semester! If you are not sure if an idea will be able to fulfil requirements email or talk to me and we can sort out how to expand upon it to meet requirements.

This project is allowed to be completed in a group if you would like. Groups can have no more than 3 members. If you do not want to work in a group that is fine but the requirements are the same either way. 

DUE: December 8th, before class. You will present your app to the class. This is the last day of the class so make sure you are ready. Presentations should show functionality of app. Also include a section in presentation for explaining biggest challenge you had and how you solved it as well as functionality most proud of. If you would like to make video of app and record audio into video or in talk over video in class that is fine as well. Presentations should be 5 - 8 minutes. Also students and myself are allowed to ask questions so be prepared for some questions.

Use of MVVM Design Pattern
Prism Framework
Use of source control
Git/Github probably easiest, the code on git should be capable of being cloned and user should be able to run you app, with only exception being needing API key
Should have at least 10 commits
If you do not like the idea of having your code public Github provides private repositories free to students
Use of navigation/navigation with parameters
Utilizing Prism’s navigation service
At least 5 pages (Views)
Use binding for commands
Little to no code in code behind files
Unit Tests
Should test as much functionality as possible
Mock Tests
Should test all uses of services (navigation, page dialog service, event aggregator)
A splash screen (counts a page)
Make use of Resources and Styles
Incorporate web service API
Twitter, Weather, NASA….
Multiple view elements: ListView, Button, BoxView, Picker, Image, Label…

Using features outside of those taught in class
Working Functionality
Inclusion of all other above items
If you are in a group every member of the group will receive the same grade.
